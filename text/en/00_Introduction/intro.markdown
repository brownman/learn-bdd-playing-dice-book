## Introduction

Hello ruby enthusiast! Hello BDD enthusiast! Welcome to this journey line by line, test by test, across of a application of *Behavior Driven Development* in a interesting project: *War Dice Simulation!*. I wrote this tiny book to learn BDD and rspec for myself. I would want to start with a little example. And if was possible with a funny example too. Then I thought: Why not playing dice! Why not playing war dice! Then there you are! Learning BDD playing dice!

The app that we'll create toguether uses two classes: Dice and WarDice. The first chapter I start to construct the rspec file of Dice class and the Dice class simultaneously and step by step until all of the tests become green. 

The second chapter I go on with the WarDice class, that is a simulation of each dice of war game! 

Finally, the third chapter I use the classes in a funny shoes application. 

The philosophy of this book is to learn making funny things. Learning while playing! In one word: *Experimentation*. Then I hope you enjoy this simple but also instructive book.

The tests used in this book aren't a silver bullet. They are only a way between some others. How I told, I made to learn rspec. You can send sugests, clone the project, modify it and codify in other ways. Who knows we'll playing together in the 2.0 version of this book :).

The complete source code of application you can download in https://github.com/valeriofarias/shoes-war-dice/tree

Now, just read, codify, test, share and have fun!
