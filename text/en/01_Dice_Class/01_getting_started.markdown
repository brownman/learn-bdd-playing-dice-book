## Getting Started 

Before start to programming let's install the essential packages. First install the rspec: 

	gem install rspec
	
If you want more usability, install the package zentest:

	gem install ZenTest
	
Now install the package autotest-notification. This gem set the autotest (ZenTest) to send messages to software as Growl, LibNotify, and Snarl, displaying a window with the results. Read the readme file of the project to know how to install: http://github.com/carlosbrando/autotest-notification/. With this three gems, our journey become funny!

To complete the bag, go to the shoes application page and read how to install in your operating system. Yes, shoes is very fun! We'll end our play with it. Access http://github.com/shoes/shoes/downloads or http://github.com/shoes/shoes. To learn how to use and execute shoes read the ebook *Nobody knows Shoes* available in http://github.com/shoes/shoes/downloads.

Now let's start our travel test by test in the BDD world!
